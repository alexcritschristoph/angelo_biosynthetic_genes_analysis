These two genomes are highly similar to Acidobacteria_gp4_AA13 and were obtained and assembled in independent samples. 
Their respective biosynthetic gene clusters were also annotated by antiSMASH (search for antiSMASH cluster GBKs with each of these genome names). 
Because they are replicates, these BGCs were not counted towards our totals in our supplemental table and cannot be looked up through that.
